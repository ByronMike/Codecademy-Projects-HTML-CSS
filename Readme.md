## General information

> A full-stack engineer can get a project done from start to finish. This path with will start with the front-end, move on to the backend, then teach you how to connect the two.
  
In this repository, I have only submitted projects that I worked on as part of my apprenticeship and labeled as "projects" (except 00A-First-Projet and 00B-Structure Project). These are personal projects to be done on one's computer, sometimes guided, sometimes with a correction but not always.

The other practical works and exercises proposed during the lessons are not mentioned. Most of the time they are simple application exercises.

## Web Development Foundations  

> Get started with the foundations. By the end of this section, you'll be able to build a stylized and responsive website with HTML and CSS.
